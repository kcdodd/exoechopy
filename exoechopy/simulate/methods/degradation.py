"""
This module provides routines for degrading the simulated data to provide more realistic noise conditions.
"""

#  ex: Add Poisson noise
#  ex: Add detector noise
#  ex: Add readout or other platform noise
#  ex: Chop up a light curve to imitate limited observation times
#  ex: Adjust data to match observations made from orbital platform
#  ex: Adjust data to match specific observation sites, times, seasons, etc.
